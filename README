Description:
	C++ implementation of equalization filters based at 
	"High-Order Digital Parametric Equalizer Design" by Sophocles J. Orfanidis

Dependencies:
	https://github.com/thedrgreenthumb/MDSPTK
	Needed for MATLAB test bench.

Implemented next filters types:
	Butterworth
	Chebyshev Type 1
	Chebyshev Type 2
	Elliptic

Classes description:
	eq - every channel consist of set of precomputed filters, 
	where every filter computed for single gain value.
	See Usage guide below.

How to run:
	Run test_orfanidis_eq.m script using MATLAB
	or
	$ python ./test_orfanidis_eq.py
	The four plots for every filter type should appear.

Usage guide:
	//Create frequency grid and equalizer objects
	freq_grid fg;
	freq_grid.set_N_bands();
	eq equalizer(fg, filter_type);
	//Set gains for every band
	equalizer.change_gains();
	//Sample by sample processing
	equalizer.sbs_process();
